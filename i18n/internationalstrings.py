                               The denylist is entirely configurable by user and may contain files that can be
                               identified as undesirable, e.g. system files; or file names that may need pre-conditioning
                               e.g. with the title 'Untitled Document'. Filename and directory searches are greedy and will
                               look for instances of the strings specified in the denylist within filename and directory
                               strings using a wildcard search. IDs e.g. PUID identifiers, and filename extension searches
                               are understandably more precise."""
