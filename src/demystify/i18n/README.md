#A lingua franca for digital archivists...

I talk a little about this here: http://openpreservation.org/blog/2016/05/24/while-were-on-the-subject-a-few-more-points-of-interest-about-the-siegfrieddroid-analysis-tool/  

But the work is just beginning...

###Summary

While I've developed an analysis tool that I want digital preservation
specialists to use, the HTML output gives us a way to create a 'live' 
glossary of terms that can be used as a common basis for discussion
across an organsation. 

![Archivist Descriptions](../documentation/archivist-descriptions.png)

We created the descriptions as a group of digital preservation experts and
archivists at Archives New Zealand. I'd like to see them translated to other
languages so that the type of information we talk about in digital preservation
and the types of break-down we may in analyses, find a common language. 

I want us to remove the jargon in how we talk about digital collections.

###Translation sheet

I have created a basic template for translation in the link below. If you can
contribute, then feel free to just create a new table column and fill out the 
gaps.

I haven't figured out a workflow for this yet, but if you'd like to let me and
the community know you've started - maybe also open an issue with your language
as the title here: https://github.com/exponential-decay/droid-siegfried-sqlite-analysis-engine/issues

###Reference report

A useful reference report, with nearly all the fields available to be seen is
this one here: [**Reference Report**](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/andreakb/parallel-lines-workshop/blob/master/spencer/droid-siegfried-sqlite-analysis-demo/e1-analysis-report.htm)
